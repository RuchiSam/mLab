Dear Customer,

Thank you for contacting us. My name is Ruchi Samdani and I would be glad to help you with this. 

I have reviewed the log file and looks like there are total 10005 errors in it.

I wrote a small shell script which I wanted to share with you (attached with this email). This script is very easy to use and would help you in the future if you come across similar situation.

Script name: parse-logs.sh
What it does: The script downloads the log file, uncompresses it, and returns the count of lines that contains the phrase "error".
Steps to use it: 
  1. Open the script in your choice of file editor
  2. Search for a variable named LOG_FILE_URL and replace the url next to it. Please note that this is the url where your log file is located.
  3. Save the changes and exit the editor.
  4. Run the script from your Linux terminal - "./parse-logs.sh"
  5. The answer will be printed on the console.

Following is how it works:
  1. It downloads the log file to your local machine (in the same directory where you are running this script) using wget command.
  2. Since log file is compressed, the script would first uncompress it using gunzip command.
  3. Now it uses 'grep' command to find the phrase"error". The grep command is used with '-c' option which counts the number of lines that contains the phrase "error".
  4. Once it knows the count, it is printed on the terminal using echo command.
  5. At the end, it deletes the log file (which was downloaded and uncompressed in step #1 and #2) to free up the space on your disk.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions.

Best Regards, 
Ruchi Samdani
